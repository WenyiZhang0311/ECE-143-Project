This is the Github Respository for ECE-143 Group 2.
Our topic is:
    COVID-19's Impact on Crime Rates in LA
Proposed Solution and Real-world Application:
    ⚫ Our proposed solution is to analyze and compare crime rates in Los Angeles before and after the
    COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to understand the influence of the pandemic on various types of
    crimes, including but not limited to property crimes, violent crimes, and public order offenses. By
    identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, we can gain valuable insights into the impact
    of COVID-19 on community safety.
    ⚫ The solution can be used to answer questions such as: Did certain types of crimes increase or
    decrease during the pandemic? Were specific neighborhoods or areas more affected than others?
    What were the key factors contributing to these changes? etc.
    ⚫ The real-world applications of this analysis extend to informing local law enforcement agencies,
    policymakers, and the general public about the effects of the pandemic on crime rates. This
    information can aid in resource allocation, public safety measures, and future pandemic preparedness.
